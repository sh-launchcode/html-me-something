                    Side note: Some things to keep in mind is that I've played several other sports including <br>
                    soccer, badminton and baseball in addition to swimming competitively. My <br>
                    younger sister did competitive gymnastics and competitive cheerleading (not to be <br> 
                    confused with your stereotypical high school football game cheerleading). <br>
                    I've watched football games, I've watched basketball games. I've watched a huge <br> 
                    amount of sports in my life and have played some of the most physically intensive sports.

                    Why Swimming is Important
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the best parts about swimming is that, well, water can't hurt you. Unlike other <br>
                    sports, swimming has little to no contact with anything that will break a bone. <br>
                    The exception of course, is other swimmers that are in your lane, where clashing <br>
                    while swimming can happen but unlikely will break a bone. In comparison to other sports <br>
                    like gymnastics or football, contact with other players or equipment are more <br>
                    likely to create injuries since these sports don't have water resistance to lower <br>
                    the speed at which you collide with something harmful. This none to little injury <br>
                    sport is the most distinctive perk over other sports. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of the no injury argument, swimming is a life skill that is just handy to know. <br>
                    Living limited and avoiding bodies of water because you can't swim, in my opinion, is <br>
                    wasting your life away. Anyone and everyone can learn how to swim regardless if you're <br>
                    missing limbs. There are so many fun things to do in the water, don't limit yourself <br>
                    to not being able to do those things.

                <h2>
                    My Swimming Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My competitive swimming career began when I was 10. Like most kids my age have done <br>
                    in my neighborhood, I've tried several sports figuring out what sport I was passionate <br>
                    about. I tried out swimming emostly because my parents thought it was a good fit <br>
                    for me since I hated to sweat. In each of my other sports, I would feel disgusting <br>
                    after practices from how much I sweat because I wasn't in shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first few years of competitive swimming started with a well known swimming organization <br>
                    in my area named <em>WAVE Aquatics</em>. Most of my memories were with a coach that led <br>
                    practices at a local Gold's Gym. I've lost a lot of memories of when I competed for WAVE. <br>
                    To be honest, I don't remember competing at all for the organization. I didn't befriend anyone <br>
                    on the team since a lot of the kids were a lot otlder than 10 year old me. After about a year, <br>
                    The coach at the Gold's Gym decided to start his own competitive team called <em>Gold's Aquatics</em><br>
                    since he was let go from WAVE. My practices were then held at a pool half an hour away from my house. <br>
                    Being fed up with the commute after a couple months, and having no dedication to the organization anyways, <br>
                    I left WAVE to join my previous coach. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like I said before, I didn't make too many friends on my old team since a lot of them were <br>
                    older than me. And it wasn't that there weren't anybody my age on the team, it was because I <br>
                    was just that fast to swim with the older kids. I had a natural talent for swimming that I could <br>
                    never see in myself. Had I been slower at swimming, I could have potentially made stronger <br>
                    friendships since I would have been more comfortable talking with people my age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My time on Gold's Aquatics was the most memorable experience as a member of a team. I really <br>
                    felt comfortable around the coach I was with on WAVE, and most of the kids I swam with were my age. <br>
                    A lot of swimmers from WAVE in my area ended up transfering just like I did. Unfortunately, <br>
                    I still wouldn't see a majority of them since I was training with a faster group, but at least <br>
                    all of them caught up to me 4 years later ("Spencer, you're a scumbag". I know).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time I was 15, I was competing with a lot of the friends that I have now. <br>
                    My coach would put us through hell during practice, but that made all of us even stronger <br>
                    friends since we would know each other's pain. When it came to swim meets, we would cheer <br>
                    each other on, cheer other people from different teams on sometimes, have great sportsmanship <br>
                    by telling our fellow competitors "nice race". The overall community of competitive swimmers and <br>
                    coaches were so supportive. We would race each other, improve from the last time we swam that event <br>
                    and just have a great time watching everyone regardless if they were successful in their <br>
                    race or not. I dreaded how much time each of the swim meets would take, but looking back <br>
                    it was all worth it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My swimming career has ended two years ago. Everyday I miss the atmosphere of spending time <br>
                    with people who had similar interests of getting better at a sport we cared about. <br>
                    The support provided at swim meets, practices, even things not related to the pool by my <br>
                    teamates, my coaches, my rivals, other competitors and coaches from different teams, <br>
                    was overwhelmingly a positive experience and community I was proud to be apart of.
