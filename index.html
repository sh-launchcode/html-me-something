                    Side note: Some things to keep in mind is that I've played several other sports including 
                    soccer, badminton and baseball in addition to swimming competitively. My 
                    younger sister did competitive gymnastics and competitive cheerleading (not to be 
                    confused with your stereotypical high school football game cheerleading). 
                    I've watched football games, I've watched basketball games. I've watched a huge 
                    amount of sports in my life and have played some of the most physically intensive sports.

                    Why Swimming is Important
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the best parts about swimming is that, well, water can't hurt you. Unlike other 
                    sports, swimming has little to no contact with anything that will break a bone. 
                    The exception of course, is other swimmers that are in your lane, where clashing 
                    while swimming can happen but unlikely will break a bone. In comparison to other sports 
                    like gymnastics or football, contact with other players or equipment are more 
                    likely to create injuries since these sports don't have water resistance to lower 
                    the speed at which you collide with something harmful. This none to little injury 
                    sport is the most distinctive perk over other sports. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of the no injury argument, swimming is a life skill that is just handy to know. 
                    Living limited and avoiding bodies of water because you can't swim, in my opinion, is 
                    wasting your life away. Anyone and everyone can learn how to swim regardless if you're 
                    missing limbs. There are so many fun things to do in the water, don't limit yourself 
                    to not being able to do those things.

                    My Swimming Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My competitive swimming career began when I was 10. Like most kids my age have done 
                    in my neighborhood, I've tried several sports figuring out what sport I was passionate 
                    about. I tried out swimming emostly because my parents thought it was a good fit 
                    for me since I hated to sweat. In each of my other sports, I would feel disgusting 
                    after practices from how much I sweat because I wasn't in shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first few years of competitive swimming started with a well known swimming organization 
                    in my area named <em>WAVE Aquatics</em>. Most of my memories were with a coach that led 
                    practices at a local Gold's Gym. I've lost a lot of memories of when I competed for WAVE. 
                    To be honest, I don't remember competing at all for the organization. I didn't befriend anyone 
                    on the team since a lot of the kids were a lot otlder than 10 year old me. After about a year, 
                    The coach at the Gold's Gym decided to start his own competitive team called <em>Gold's Aquatics</em> 
                    since he was let go from WAVE. My practices were then held at a pool half an hour away from my house. 
                    Being fed up with the commute after a couple months, and having no dedication to the organization anyways, 
                    I left WAVE to join my previous coach. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like I said before, I didn't make too many friends on my old team since a lot of them were 
                    older than me. And it wasn't that there weren't anybody my age on the team, it was because I 
                    was just that fast to swim with the older kids. I had a natural talent for swimming that I could 
                    never see in myself. Had I been slower at swimming, I could have potentially made stronger 
                    friendships since I would have been more comfortable talking with people my age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My time on Gold's Aquatics was the most memorable experience as a member of a team. I really 
                    felt comfortable around the coach I was with on WAVE, and most of the kids I swam with were my age. 
                    A lot of swimmers from WAVE in my area ended up transfering just like I did. Unfortunately, 
                    I still wouldn't see a majority of them since I was training with a faster group, but at least 
                    all of them caught up to me 4 years later ("Spencer, you're a scumbag". I know).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time I was 15, I was competing with a lot of the friends that I have now. 
                    My coach would put us through hell during practice, but that made all of us even stronger 
                    friends since we would know each other's pain. When it came to swim meets, we would cheer 
                    each other on, cheer other people from different teams on sometimes, have great sportsmanship 
                    by telling our fellow competitors "nice race". The overall community of competitive swimmers and 
                    coaches were so supportive. We would race each other, improve from the last time we swam that event 
                    and just have a great time watching everyone regardless if they were successful in their 
                    race or not. I dreaded how much time each of the swim meets would take, but looking back 
                    it was all worth it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My swimming career has ended two years ago. Everyday I miss the atmosphere of spending time 
                    with people who had similar interests of getting better at a sport we cared about. 
                    The support provided at swim meets, practices, even things not related to the pool by my 
                    teamates, my coaches, my rivals, other competitors and coaches from different teams, 
                    was overwhelmingly a positive experience and community I was proud to be apart of.
