                    Side note: As contreversial as my header is, keep in mind that I've played <br>
                    soccer, badminton and baseball in addition to swimming competitively. My <br>
                    younger sister did competitive gymnastics and competitive cheerleading (not to be <br> 
                    confused with your stereotypical high school football game cheerleaders). <br>
                    I've watched football games, I've watched basketball games. I've watched a huge <br> 
                    amount of sports in my life and have played some of the most physically intensive sports.
